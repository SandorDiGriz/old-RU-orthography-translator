# old-RU-orthography-translator

Welcome, stranger!

This project was created by a group of students of the HSE SPB as part of the work on building a corpus of Russian-language literary texts. This module allows to bring texts in pre-revolutionary spelling into a modern form. The code is based on the use of regular expressions and an exception dictionary.
